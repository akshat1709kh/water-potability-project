Selected Project: Water Potability Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict water potability based on various water quality parameters. This model will help in assessing whether water is safe for consumption, which is crucial for public health and water management.
Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict water potability based on various water quality parameters. This model will help in assessing whether water is safe for consumption, which is crucial for public health and water management.
 

Project Guidelines:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Load data, handle missing values, check distributions, address outliers, and scale features.
Feature Engineering:
Analyze correlations, create/transform features if needed.
Handling Class Imbalance:
Balance data using SMOTE.
Model Selection and Training:
Split data, compare SVC, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost classifiers with cross validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize models with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores.
Feature Importance:
Analyze and visualize feature importances for tree-based models.
Results and Visualization:
Visualize model performance and summarize findings.
Code Quality:
Ensure clean, well-documented code in Jupyter notebooks.
